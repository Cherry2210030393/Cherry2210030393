## 👨‍💻 Who is This Curious Cyber Explorer?

Hey there! I'm a **relentlessly curious cybersecurity enthusiast** with a knack for understanding how things break — and an even bigger passion for learning how to secure them.

🔍 From reverse engineering a bug to scripting my own tools, I’m constantly navigating the cyber universe one vulnerability at a time. Whether it’s dissecting a CTF challenge at 2 AM or automating scans on my home lab, I live for the adrenaline of discovery.

💡 I’m not just learning cybersecurity — I’m *living it*, breathing it, and building my mindset around *thinking like an attacker to protect like a defender*.

### 🧠 Always hungry to explore:
- 🛡 Ethical hacking & penetration testing  
- 🌐 Web, network, and cloud security  
- 🔁 DevSecOps pipelines & security automation  
- 🎯 Red teaming strategies and blue team countermeasures  
- 🔧 Building open-source tools for real-world security problems

🎓 Still a student by title, but already a researcher by mindset. My goal? **To become a warrior of the web — one script, one exploit, one secure system at a time.**

> *"Curiosity is not a trait I possess. It’s a lifestyle I chose — in the world of 1s and 0s."*
